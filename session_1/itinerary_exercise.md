## Itinerary kata

PortTrucks is a company that has a fleet of drivers in charge of picking up the
containers from different deposits and taking them to different ports to be loaded and unloaded.

The office members of the company would like to know in real time where the driver is and
which stops have been completed. These are the requirements:

- The container is always transported from a hand-in to a hand-off deposit.
- The itinerary can also have intermediate stops to load and unload the container.
- Once all stops are completed the itinerary is considered completed.
- Stops get completed once the driver arrives to the location.
- The driver can always consult the next stop to complete (pending).
- The hand-in is always the first stop.
- The hand-off is always the last stop.
